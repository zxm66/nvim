#### nvim in my eyes
* it is only a editor . and not an IDE.
* how to use the vim as a editor
* does the vim editor complete you ?

I use the vim to write java code . but I don't to make vim like the IDEA.
and I tell me that how to re-understand the java code . and what is codding?

* the first question is that what is building?
* the second question ALL is file . is not you complete me .
* the third question is how to write code. and now I should write from top to bottom.
